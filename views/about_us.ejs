                <h3>Timothy C.</h3>
                <p>I am a 6th grader at a school named STEM school highlands ranch. I enjoy coding at my house. I also like to ski during the winter and bike and play tennis in the summer. I travel a lot but I do it all in my car. My favorite store is the Micro Center. I am proud to announce that we are protecting more lives which will make more tech and more advanced stuff. When this shield is needed which we hope it is never needed but we donâ€™t want to take any risks. I was very worried about all of these school shootings and hoped that this would never happen to me. So me and my group decided that it was a good idea that we create this tactical defense shield to protect the lives of our future lives, engineers, and advancement in technology. With this new idea of this shield my group and I have decided to release this product and help the future lives of this Earth. Without this shield we can protect ourselves and the future of technology. I believe that the sooner we release this product the more lives we will save now and in the future. When we release this product we will make sure that it is very affordable so that everyone can have this product to protect themselves and their school or class. </p>
